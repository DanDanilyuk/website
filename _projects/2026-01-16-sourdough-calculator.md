**Description**:
The Sourdough Calculator is a comprehensive baking tool that helps home bakers precisely calculate ingredient amounts for both starter feeding and bread baking. It features two integrated calculators: a starter feeding calculator that determines optimal feeding ratios based on desired timing, and a bread baking calculator that computes exact ingredient measurements based on flour type, hydration levels, and target dough weight.

**Features**:

- Dual calculator interface for starter feeding and bread baking
- Six timing presets for starter feeding (4-6 hours to 16-24 hours)
- Support for multiple hydration levels (50%, 75%, 100%, 125%)
- Automatic calculation of starter, flour, and water amounts
- Flour-type-specific hydration recommendations (All-Purpose, Bread, Whole Wheat, Rye, Spelt)
- Container weight compensation for accurate measurements
- Preset dough hydration options for different bread types (Bagels, Standard Loaf, Ciabatta, Focaccia)
- Real-time ingredient calculations with adjustable salt percentage
- Temperature-based timing guidance (75°F / 24°C ambient)
- Clean, tab-based interface for easy navigation between calculators

**Motivation**: Sourdough baking requires precise ingredient ratios and timing that can be challenging to calculate manually. This project eliminates the guesswork by automating baker's percentage calculations and providing timing guidance for starter feeding. By accounting for container weight, starter hydration, and flour-specific characteristics, it helps bakers achieve consistent results without complex math.

**Technologies Used**:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Responsive design with tab-based navigation
- Real-time calculation algorithms
- Baker's percentage formulas

**Impact**: The Sourdough Calculator simplifies the technical aspects of sourdough baking, making it more accessible to beginners while providing precision tools for experienced bakers. It reduces waste by calculating exact amounts needed and helps bakers plan their baking schedule by providing accurate timing estimates for starter readiness.
